The LDABERTModelerDIDNOTUSE file contains code that was ultimately scrapped for the GPT-4o classification. It did not perform as intended and may not function as some structures may have changed when swapping to the GPT-4o classification. The coding structure remains the same and can be seen for the models used. The results from these models is available in the supplementary materials folder. 

The Supplementary materials folder contains the data at all stages of the code.
